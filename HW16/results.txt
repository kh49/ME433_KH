My robot detected the line by subtracting the intensity of green from red. Two of the three sliders controlled the weight of each color in the threshold calculation. The single point, along with the setting of the third slider, was sent to the PIC as a large number with the first three decimal places corresponding to COM and the last three corresponding to the slider setting. The PIC used the slider as a manual max speed setting to help me tweak steering. The COM was used to calculate how off center the line was and steer the PIC. The PIC controls both relative motor speed for steering and absolute motor speed for throttle based on the COM so it can go through each turn at an optimal speed. Although my code for tech cup was not fully optimized, it still managed to get a 32s lap time. After giving the PIC full control of the throttle, I was able to get the time down to 29s.
